# Adventure Game

This project is a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game.

The game presents the player some scenarios and asks to make one of 2 choices, by entering 1 or 2.

## Quickstart

Download the zip or clone the directory to your computer and, from inside the directory, run the game with `python adventure_game.py` (or `python3 adventure_game.py`)
